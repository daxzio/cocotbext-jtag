---

## Bug #1: Critical Logic Error in `_parse_tdo()` Method
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:147-157`
**Severity:** Critical
**Description:** The `_parse_tdo()` method has a race condition where `self.ret_val` is set without proper synchronization, potentially causing incorrect read results.
**Issue:** The method updates `self.ret_val` based on `self.rx_fsm.state` but there's no guarantee that the state machine and data are in sync.
**Impact:** Incorrect data reads from JTAG devices, leading to silent data corruption.

## Bug #2: Unsafe Exception Handling in State Machine
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:154-156`
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The exception handling for read verification uses a bare `Exception` which masks the actual error type.
**Issue:** `raise Exception(f"Expected: 0x{self.dr_val:08x} Returned: 0x{self.ret_val:08x}")` provides poor error context.
**Impact:** Difficult debugging and error handling by downstream code.

## Bug #3: Potential Division by Zero in Clock Frequency Calculation
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:53`
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The frequency calculation `self.frequency = 1000_000_000 / self.period` doesn't check for zero period.
**Issue:** If `period` is 0, this will cause a ZeroDivisionError.
**Impact:** Application crash when invalid period values are provided.

## Bug #4: Memory Leak in Transaction Queue
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_monitor.py:70-74`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The `queue_txn` deque continuously grows without bounds.
**Issue:** No mechanism to clear old transactions, leading to unbounded memory growth.
**Impact:** Memory exhaustion in long-running simulations.

## Bug #5: Inconsistent Error Handling for Missing Attributes
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:119-121`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The `set_reset()` method only warns when reset is not present but doesn't handle the case consistently.
**Issue:** Some methods assume reset exists while others check for it, leading to inconsistent behavior.
**Impact:** Unexpected behavior when reset signal is not available.

## Bug #6: Type Safety Issue with Signal Values
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_sm.py:269-272`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** String comparisons with signal values are fragile and error-prone.
**Issue:** Code uses string comparisons like `"x" == self.bus.tdo.value` which may not work across all simulators.
**Impact:** Simulator-specific failures and incorrect behavior.

## Bug #7: Resource Leak in Socket Connection
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/ocd_client.py:69-73`
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The socket connection in `stop_socket()` doesn't properly handle exceptions during shutdown.
**Issue:** Missing try-catch around socket operations can leave connections in an inconsistent state.
**Impact:** Resource leaks and potential deadlocks.

## Bug #8: Potential Integer Overflow in Address Calculation
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:188-195`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Address calculations can overflow when dealing with large device chains.
**Issue:** `self.total_ir_val += v << self.total_ir_len` can overflow with large values.
**Impact:** Incorrect address calculations leading to wrong device selection.

## Bug #9: Missing Validation for Device Parameters
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_device.py:71-78`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The `add_jtag_reg()` method doesn't validate that addresses don't conflict.
**Issue:** Multiple registers can have the same address, causing undefined behavior.
**Impact:** Unpredictable device behavior and debugging difficulties.

## Bug #10: Thread Safety Issue in State Machine
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_sm.py:59-61`
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The state machine variables are not thread-safe but accessed from multiple coroutines.
**Issue:** State variables like `self.state` can be modified concurrently without proper synchronization.
**Impact:** Race conditions leading to corrupted state machine behavior.

## Bug #11: Infinite Loop Potential in Clock Generation
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/gatedclock.py:168-175`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The clock generation loop has no exit condition or cancellation mechanism.
**Issue:** `while True:` loop with no break condition can't be cleanly terminated.
**Impact:** Difficulty in stopping simulations cleanly.

## Bug #12: Improper Error Handling in Timer Creation
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:93-98`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The timer creation has inconsistent exception handling for different cocotb versions.
**Issue:** `try/except` blocks catch broad exceptions but don't handle all edge cases.
**Impact:** Compatibility issues across different cocotb versions.

## Bug #13: Missing Input Validation in Constructor
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:44-49`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** No validation of input parameters like `period` and `unit`.
**Issue:** Invalid parameters can be passed without validation, causing runtime errors later.
**Impact:** Delayed error detection and poor user experience.

## Bug #14: Potential Buffer Overflow in TCP Communication
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/ocd_client.py:108-111`
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The TCP buffer handling doesn't properly check bounds.
**Issue:** `self.txbuf += tdo` can grow beyond `TCP_SIZE` without proper checks.
**Impact:** Memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Bug #15: Logic Error in Random Pause Generation
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_sm.py:71-77`
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The random pause generation logic has incorrect probability calculation.
**Issue:** `if 0 == randint(0, 4):` gives 20% probability instead of a more reasonable distribution.
**Impact:** Unrealistic test scenarios and poor coverage of timing edge cases.

## Bug #16: Missing Cleanup in Class Destructor
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:44-90`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** No cleanup mechanism for started coroutines and resources.
**Issue:** `start_soon()` calls create coroutines but there's no cleanup when the driver is destroyed.
**Impact:** Resource leaks and zombie coroutines.

## Bug #17: Incorrect Bit Manipulation in Data Shifting
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_sm.py:131-135`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Bit shifting operations don't handle edge cases properly.
**Issue:** `self.dr_val = self.dr_val >> 1` doesn't handle None values correctly.
**Impact:** Incorrect data transmission and potential crashes.

## Bug #18: Hardcoded Values in Protocol Implementation
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_device.py:41-44`
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** BYPASS register address is hardcoded without flexibility.
**Issue:** `self.address = (2**self.ir_len) - 1` assumes standard JTAG behavior.
**Impact:** Incompatibility with non-standard JTAG implementations.

## Bug #19: Missing Timeout Handling in Blocking Operations
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:208-230`
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The `send_val()` method can block indefinitely waiting for completion.
**Issue:** No timeout mechanism in `while not self.tx_fsm.finished:` loop.
**Impact:** Potential deadlocks in simulation.

## Bug #20: Inconsistent Logging Levels and Format
**File:** `cocotbext/jtag/jtag_driver.py:52` and throughout
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Logging levels are inconsistent across the codebase.
**Issue:** Some debug information is logged at INFO level while critical errors use generic messages.
**Impact:** Difficult debugging and inconsistent log output.
